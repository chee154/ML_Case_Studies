# ML_Case_Studies

Goal of this repository is doing a deep dive and analysis on many types of Machine Learning models, includes the following:
1. Linear and Logistic Regression
2. RandomForest and Naive Bayes Classifiers
3. KMeans Clustering
4. XGBoost and LightGBM
5. SVM and SGD
6. Dense Neural Networks (PyTorch)
7. Ensembling using PyCaret Optimization

Other Contributers include:
Neil Benson, Adam Canton and Edward Roske
